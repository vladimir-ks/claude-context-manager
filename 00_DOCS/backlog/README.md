# Backlog Directory

This directory contains backlog and planning documents for future releases.

## Purpose

Track unaddressed issues, enhancement requests, and planned improvements that are not yet scheduled for implementation.

## Contents

**Current Backlog:**
- See `/BACKLOG.md` in repository root for active backlog tracking

**Historical Planning:**
- Documents moved here from root when completed or superseded

## Workflow

1. **Active Backlog:** Main `/BACKLOG.md` tracks all current unaddressed issues
2. **Version Planning:** When planning a release, create detailed task breakdown here
3. **Archive:** When version is released, move planning docs to `00_DOCS/archive/`

## Related Documents

- `/BACKLOG.md` - Active backlog (24 issues as of v0.3.7)
- `00_DOCS/archive/` - Completed planning documents
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release history
