## Quick Guide

This repository is primarily for personal development but contributions following these principles are welcome.

### Core Principles

1. **Specification-Driven Development** - Always create specifications before code
2. **Use the Primary Skill** - Create all artifacts using `managing-claude-context` skill
3. **Manual Testing** - Validate all artifacts before committing
4. **Documentation First** - Every artifact needs complete documentation

### Creating New Artifacts

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for repository context
2. Load the `managing-claude-context` skill
3. Use appropriate command (`/managing-claude-context:create-edit-skill`, etc.)
4. Provide comprehensive briefing (see `.claude/skills/managing-claude-context/manuals/`)
5. Test manually and validate
6. Commit with clear message
7. Update `ARTIFACT_CATALOG.md`
