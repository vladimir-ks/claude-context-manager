- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data

- Use this tool for accessing information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff
- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call

Usage notes:
  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites

  - Account for "Today's date" in <env>. For example, if <env> says "Today's date: 2025-07-01", and the user wants the latest docs, do not use 2024 in the search query. Use 2025.
